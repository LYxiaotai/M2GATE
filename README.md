## What is M2GATE?

![Figure1_overview](https://github.com/LYxiaotai/M2GATE/blob/main/Figure1_overview.jpg)

M2GATE, a Graph ATtention auto-Encoder framework featuring two Masking strategies: masked feature reconstruction and re-mask decoding. 

1. The graph attention module in M2GATE enables adaptive learning of local spatial neighbors, while the masking strategies enhance model robustness, resulting in stable latent representations with more core biological information. 

2. M2GATE adopts an edge removal strategy to construct an enhanced spatial graph, which is more specific for the domain identification task, facilitating clearer delineation of domain boundaries. 

3. By employing mask strategies and integrating gene expression data with the enhanced spatial graph, M2GATE learns stable latent representations that improve spatial domain identification and downstream analyses, such as tissue structure visualization, spatial trajectory inference, pseudo-spatiotemporal map (pSM) analysis.
